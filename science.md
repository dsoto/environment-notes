# ENSP 200, Class 2, Science and Scientific Method

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how science and the scientific method aids our understanding of the environment

## Scientific Method
- How do we create new scientific knowledge?
- Often start with a hypothesis
- We then design experiments that will provide evidence for or against
  the hypothesis
- If there is overwhelming evidence, a hypothesis can move from a
  hypothesis to a theory and then to a law

## Peer review
- Scientists publish new results in journals
- Before publication, qualified scientists review these results and
  approve or disapprove publication
<!-- imagine the comments on youtube -->

## Skepticism
- A good scientist is always trying to disprove herself
- Only considering evidence confirming your belief is inconsistent with
  the scientific method

## Levels of scientific rigor
- Frontier science not widely tested
- Accepted science has lots of evidence and acceptance
- Junk science presented as scientific without peer-review

## Climate science
- We proposed the basic concepts of global warming in the late 1800's
- Since then we have been steadily collecting evidence to support the
  hypothesis that the climate system is changing because of human carbon
  combustion

## Controversy around climate science

<!-- why do some people think climate scientists should be killed -->

## How do different scientific fields impact our understanding?

## Physics
- Answers how energy flows through the earth's systems

## Chemistry
- How do elements form chemical compounds?
- What chemicals are formed when you burn a chemical
- Some materials are harmful because of their chemical structure
- Some materials are harmful because of their nuclear structure

## Combustion

## Fission

## Biology
- What are the rules that govern life?
- What happens to organisms if we increase the temperature?

## Ecology
- How do systems of organisms cooperate and thrive in ecosystems?
- What happens to an ecosystem if one organism disappears?

## Psychology
- What are the rules that govern the human mind?

## Sociology
- What are the rules that govern social behavior?

## Political science
- What relationships explain political events?

## Limitations of science
- What questions is science unable to answer?
- What weaknesses does science have?

## Normative vs Positive
- Normative is how things should be
- Positive is how they are
- Science can only address positive questions
